Potential Pathways

The next morning, Witsan awoke with a start, their mind racing with thoughts of work, personal growth, and the future. They made breakfast and decided to sit down on the couch they had found in the empty office space. Their phone started buzzing 
with messages as soon as they reached the kitchen.

"Hey Witsan! What's up?" A familiar voice asked, sending a warm sensation through their veins. They looked at the person standing next to them on the couch, an energetic woman who managed The Ministry of Equity. Her voice was infectious, and Witsan
couldn't help but laugh despite the seriousness of the conversation.

"Hi, Ivy! What's up?" They chuckled as they took a seat in their new office, one that was notably smaller than their previous digs. The walls were filled with posters of their favorite bands and politicians, reminding them of the importance of 
public engagement and diplomacy.

"I just got this intel from my boss," Ivy began, her eyes wide as she shared a secret they had managed to keep for the past eight months. "The fractured knee issue is no longer an issue for Ministry of Equity. The fractured knee was caused by a 
work accident a few months earlier. They had tried to transfer to a different ministry after the incident, but at 33 years old, they were not allowed the opportunity to change careers."

Witsan's eyes widened in surprise as he realized that their age was one of the reasons they had been given an exception despite their inexperience. He looked over at Ivy, who beamed with pride at her success. The two friends exchanged knowing 
glances before Witsan continued, "That's some sh*t! That's great news, Ivy."

"Thank you, Witsan," replied Ivy, a grin playing across her face as she reached out to squeeze his hand. "I think it's time we all took a moment to reflect and reassess our goals."

As they continued to catch up on their lives outside of work, the realization that they were now two decades older hit them both. Witsan took this opportunity to reminisce about their younger years and how far they had come as individuals and as a 
team. They shared stories of their struggles with the system, the sacrifices they had made, and how far they had come in overcoming those obstacles.

Ivy agreed that there was no denying it â€“ they had faced numerous setbacks along the way. Witsan felt grateful for their friendship and the support they had provided each other throughout their journeys. They decided to dedicate a few minutes of 
their day to reflect on their accomplishments, dreams, and aspirations.

They got up early that morning, Witsan preparing his breakfast while Ivy got ready for work. As they sat down in the shared kitchen, they realized that they had not yet met the woman who was going to take over their departed jobs. She had been 
assigned to The Ministry of Equity, and they were both excited about the possibilities for growth and innovation that lay ahead.

"We should invite her in," Ivy suggested as they discussed what they should do next. Witsan agreed that it would be a great opportunity to learn from each other and grow their own knowledge base. They decided to postpone any official introductions 
or presentations for the time being, focusing on their shared goals and commitments.

As they continued to catch up on work, new ideas began to take shape in Witsan's mind. He thought about the various projects he had been working on, many of which were still unfinished. These ideas were the culmination of years of hard work, 
dedication, and sacrifice. They were the result of their collective efforts to change the system for the betterment of the people they served.

"We should start by focusing on The Ministry of Equity," Witsan suggested. He thought it was important to start with a bone in their throat, as they had been there long enough to realize that nothing would be accomplished unless they took charge 
and made things happen.

"I agree, but how are we going to attract the right talent?" Ivy asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement. They both knew that the next few years would be crucial in shaping the future of their departed Ministry.

"We need to start by creating a sense of urgency and purpose. We can do this by focusing on the work we have already accomplished and highlighting the successes of our predecessors." Witsan agreed, recalling the time when they had created an 
innovative program that helped thousands of individuals make their transition from poverty to prosperity.

"But what about all the other departments?" Ivy asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement once again. They both knew that there were plenty of opportunities for growth and advancement in the Ministry of Equity.

Witsan shook his head in disbelief, thinking about the countless hours they had spent working on various projects within the department. He recalled a time when he had to help an older technician who was struggling with his workload. Witsan had 
managed to get him to see things from a different perspective and eventually convinced him that he could do it without sacrificing his own productivity or sanity.

"We can't let past mistakes dictate our future," Witsan said, emphasizing the importance of learning from their past successes and failures. "Our goal must be to create a culture where people feel empowered to take risks and make things happen."

As they continued to think through their plan for The Ministry of Equity, Ivy agreed with Witsan's approach, adding that it was crucial to focus on the work they had already accomplished and highlighting the successes of our predecessors. They both
knew that this new chapter in their lives would require a significant amount of effort and dedication, but they were ready for the challenge.

As they sat back down and discussed the next steps, Witsan couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to work with such amazing colleagues and friends. They knew that this was only the beginning of their journey, and they were determined 
to make a difference in people's lives.
