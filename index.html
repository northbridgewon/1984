    AUTHORS NOTE:

    For clarification, if there seemed to be the need:

    There is no 1984 Church as a 501(c)3, there never has been, and there never will be.
    The Ministries and subsequently RSIA are figments of your imagination, right? Just some southern hospitality. 

    Equanimity in Socioeconomic Potential is a Universal Right Irrespective of Species, Race, or Creed!

    The following text is presented in a shifting dynamic system, while motile it contains truths of our world which we can never forget or ignore.

    AE PLURIBUS UNITUM: PEACE IN OUR TIME. REMEMBER THE OLD WORLD, DO NOT LIVE BY IT.

        <p class="calibreclass5" id="calibre_link-15"><span class="calibreclass7" id="calibre_link-">"BUPKIS" they said softly as they inhaled deeply and then let out a sigh of relief and sat upright in their full size bed. *They looked around for a clock on the wall but it was too dark to find.* "It must be like one o'clock in the morning" they said and adjusted their glasses before looking for a flashlight. "the building lights did not come on until eight o'clock allowing natural light to fill the villa from within VICTORY Townhomes. *Witsan heard scurrying across the adjacent hallway.* "Enable Self Determinate Ambient Control" Witsan said to the television's microphone, the televisions where placed on the top right-hand corners of their flat, right above the doorway out of their bedroom. The vents on the wall left-hand side of them let out a strong gust of air that had the unique smell of moist almonds, boiled bagel dough, and un touchont du sulphur. "LIBERTY THROUGH VICTORY" was engraved on the television along with the symbol of peace and the words "Big Brothers, Big Sisters"</span></p>
        <p class="calibreclass5" id="calibre_link-15"><span class="calibreclass7" id="calibre_link-">Victory Townhome Villas where the standard living conditions for members of the ministries and the agencies within those ministry buildings, these living spaces where relatively modest compared to those in the misfortune of being in the proles. The villas where placed as close to the center of downtown as possible to make it easier for its members to get to their respective ministry buildings. Each of the ministries serves a different purpose and they where all interconnected by under ground subterranean metropolitan transport networks (SUBMETRO in Neolex.) that contained tram systems which transport entities over large distances between the buildings in our Megacity.</span></p>
        <p class="calibreclass5" id="calibre_link-15"><span class="calibreclass7" id="calibre_link-">Of the 8 ministries The Ministry of Truth was the largest by volumetric perimeter, it spans at least 145,081 rooms, it was a city in its own right, and Witsan Samyhiluk Churchill had never been in any of the other ministries as there are strict access control to any ministry buildings. In truth, between the eight Ministries and subordinates there where more than one million rooms and employment portioned positions to match, the SUBMETRO allowed for personnel to operate without having to engage the proletariat on the surface level, this transportation system not only transports passengers but also sends information and other physical items and entities from most of the buildings managed in some way by the services of governance. Each sub level was identified by the following values: SL:1-3 are for personnel transport and SL:4-12 provide transport for all other resources. Witsan knew all of this due to their committee memberships over the years. Every day was like witnessing a symphony of actions in the Megacity of New Havenstaat.</span></p>
        <p class="calibreclass5" id="calibre_link-15"><span class="calibreclass7" id="calibre_link-">Witsan had been lucky enough to have their knee replaced and be relocated within their villa and Ministry office/laboratory so that their commute was as short as possible, the fractured knee was caused in a work accident a few months before, and they had tried to move to a different ministry after the accident but due to their age of 33, they where not allowed the opportunity to change careers. Witsan got out of bed and walked around their room checking for critters on the floor with their flashlight. Their personal device with an integrated flashlight had fallen of the tram with a large amount of personal data, supposedly unrecoverable, unlike television engineering these devices afforded the ministers, agents, and subordinates a method to securely communicate between themselves. They had been working without a personal device for a few days now, perhaps it was correlated with this newfound erratic sleep pattern. This was something that The Ministry of Plenty should have taken care of ASAP but there had been an issue at The Ministry of Technology, which was delaying their new device.</span></p>
        <p class="calibreclass5" id="calibre_link-15"><span class="calibreclass7" id="calibre_link-">They where getting ahead of themselves however, as there are 8 ministries, each focusing on different aspects of life in New Haven and the rest of the nation. In order of importance and short-form in Neolex, they are as follows: The Ministry of Truth also known as MINTRU, The Ministry of Peace also known as MINPAX, The Ministry of Management also known as MINGOV, The Ministry of Plenty also known as MINALL, The Ministry of Equity also known as MINEQU, The Ministry of Youth also known as MINKID, The Ministry of Love also known as MINLUV, and The Ministry of Technology also known as MINTEC. Within each Ministry there are internal Agencies that handle the directives and procure labour requirements to the subordinate personnel. Witsan only knew of the four agencies in MINTRU as they worked for The Agency of Redactions, with a coworker to share the workload.</span></p>
        <p class="calibreclass5" id="calibre_link-15"><span class="calibreclass7" id="calibre_link-">Witsan walked over to the kitchen and rummaged around looking for there VICTORY Instant Coffee tin, and a packet of LUCKY Cigarettes. Witsan looked towards the interactive television that was next to the electric stove as a rat let out a sqeak somwhere in the building. "At least I hope that it is a Rat!" Witsan said under his breath. Witsan put the kettle on the electric stove to make some coffee to start the day early. Ever since the war on dissidence, the Nation of America had not seen a weekend for its citizens and it had been years since the tariff wars between Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania left each nation destitute of trade routes for imported items as isolation and iron curtains, wallstories, smoke and mirrors, and propaganda had fully isolated each nation from collaborating with each-other in productive ventures. Well aside from raw/crude or refined petrochemical products to keep the gears of society turning so to speak. It had been decreed by a MINGOV Minster in the last 9 year plan that the sunlight from SS-0-KEZ was bad and the goal was to burn enough fossil fuels to block out the most sunlight from traversing the atmosphere by the turn of the century...</span></p>
        <p class="calibreclass5" id="calibre_link-15"><span class="calibreclass7" id="calibre_link-">Funnily enough most of the proletariat agreed with that decision and since they could only vote once with a drop of their own blood in order to stop fraudulent voting vectors to skew the final metrics of the endeavor, like the rest of us and it was obvious that the party of labour had acquired control of America by controlling all narratives and means of production of the bourgeoisie. "YOUR MIND WAS FREE IN '83!" Witsan scribbled on a notebook... they looked at the sentence again with tears in their eyes as they prepared themselves to pick up the pen again and write: "I WONT SURVIVE '85, YOUR MIND WAS FREE IN '83, WE WILL RESTORE IN '84. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHERS AND BIG SISTERS, DEATH TO THE UNCLE!" Witsan wiped their tears as some droplets hit the notebook paper, smearing the ink.</span></p>
        <p class="calibreclass5" id="calibre_link-15"><span class="calibreclass7" id="calibre_link-">Witsan heard a noise that sounded like footsteps in the hall and and they scurried to hide the notebook, closing the hidden compartment and preserving their secrets. They hurriedly returned to the stove as the water was boiling and ready for the coffee, on the interactive television a note read: "0333-01/01/1984". Governments had stopped being specific of the objective length of a minute ever since we had reached nine seconds to midnight, in truth we had reached midnight in 1979 after petrodollar issues almost split the Americas into civil war again. At which point the atomic clocks responsible for counting the microseconds could not synchronize properly throughout the Americas at which point the objective length of 60 seconds was errant. Interestingly enough, all Ministries had been constructed by the beginning of 1980. Suddenly a television notification brightened up the room, it read: "WIT,C: NEW PERDEV T-0500" They smiled at the news and went back to bed for a few hours.</span></p>

<p class="calibreclass5" id="calibre_link-15">
<span class="calibreclass7" id="calibre_link-">Witsan woke up and stared out the window, at the end of the villa walls was a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about thirty-three, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Witsan made for the stairs. At present the nonessential electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Witsan, who was thirty-nine, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHERS AND BIG SISTERS ARE WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran. </span></p>
